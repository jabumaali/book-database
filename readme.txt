A customizable database for all my favorite books.

This project highlights practicing SQL queries using Python's SQL ORM SQLAlchemy.

An initial list of books and their info is read from a CSV with a handmade function.
The menu prompts the user to:
Add a book,
View all books,
Search for a book,
Analyze the database, or
Exit the program.

With human-friendly print statements, you're sure to come back for more.
